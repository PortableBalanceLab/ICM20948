# `ICM20948.py`

> The IMU demo script given to students doing `S2` (IMU) in the PBL course

This script was copied out of the guide that Waveshare provides with its Sense HAT product.

- Guide link: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Sense_HAT_(B)
- Source code archive link (from which `ICM20948.py` is copied): https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/6/6c/Sense-HAT-B-Demo.7z

The reason it's copied here is so that there is a public PBL repository that hosts the code, so
that (e.g.) Pi installers can grab the latest version with `git clone https://github.com/PortableBalanceLab/ICM20948`
